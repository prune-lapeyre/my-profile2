				I am passionate about fashion. Through fashion, one can express oneself in different ways and be the person one wants to be.  That's why I would like to work in fashion later on.
				</p>
				<p>Below, you will find Vogue's reviews of the different "Spring 2023 Ready to Wear" fashion shows of the luxury houses.

				Cosmetics is one of the fields that attracts me a lot since I was a little girl. Indeed, I find it fascinating to know that through products we can pass a lot of messages. It's a real means of expression and I would even say a form of art.
				</p>
				<p>
				Below the videos Beauty secret from Vogue. They are for me a real joy and a way to discover new products and tips from celebrities who love cosmetics like me.

				Being part of my life for many years, digital is a field I particularly like. However, since my first three years at Essec Business School, I was able to discover more about digital and I love it. Everything related to e-business and communication attracts me. 
				</p>
				<p>
				I was able to realize an omnichannel analysis on the Gucci house during my e-business course and I was also able to take care of the communication on the various projects of creation of companies. 
				This year I am taking an advertising and communication course. 
				Below, the advertisement "Lait drôle la vie" of Monoprix realized by Rosapark which marked me when I saw it for the first time and that I do not forget.

				I love music. I think it is something very important and interesting. Thanks to it, you can feel a lot of emotions, the feeling of traveling, having fun or just remembering memories. You can find one of my favorite music below.
